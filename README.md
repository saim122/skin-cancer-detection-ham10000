# Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains my undergraduate final year project focused on automated skin cancer detection using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify skin lesion images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The model is trained and evaluated on the HAM10000 skin lesion dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Google Colab
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
HAM10000 (Human Against Machine with 10000 training images) skin lesion dataset.
The dataset is publicly available and widely used for research purposes.

## Notes
Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.
